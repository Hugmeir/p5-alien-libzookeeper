Revision history for Alien-libzookeeper

0.04    2020-12-01
        * Ongoing improvements to libzookeeper;
          the version we build now works with the 'defualt' perls from
          Debian, Fedora, Alpine, ArchLinux, CentOS, and OSX.

0.03    2020-11-30
        * Further improvements to zookeeper's cmake build process;
          we now generate a libzookeeper_mt.{so,a}, so we should
          be fully compatible with existing pkg-config providers,
          and then some!

0.02    2020-11-22
        * Several patches for the manually built libzookeeper
        * Handling for several ways libzookeeper can show up on the system:
            as libzookeeper, with pkg-config
            as libzookeeper, with no pkg-config
            as libzookeeper_mt, with no pkg-config
        * Docs!
